online\_mesh\_mapper
====================

The online mesh mapper is a mapping utility, which generates a mesh map
in real time using a pointcloud2. The ros node publishes a mesh of the
type mesh\_msgs/msg/MeshGeometryStamped
(<https://github.com/naturerobots/mesh_tools/blob/main/mesh_msgs/msg/MeshGeometryStamped.msg>).
A wavefront file also gets created when terminating the node.

This mapping utility uses a greedy meshing algorithm by default. it can
be changed by changing the source code and recompiling the package,
however changes should only be made when only one thread is availibile

Parameters for usage
--------------------

Within the package directory there is a launch file with all the
parameters neccessary for the usage of the ros2 node. Those parameters
are:

1.  in\_topic: The topic name of the incoming pointcloud transformed to
    a frame with global coordinates
2.  frame\_id: The frame\_id of in\_topic
3.  odometry\_msg\_topic: The topic of type ros2
    nav\_msgs\_msg\_odometry that tells the node where the robot is
4.  scalar: The factor that determines the resolution of the map model:
    the resolution is: 1m/scalar
5.  render\_distance\_horizontal: The horizontal render distance in
    chunks. 1 chunk is 32 blocks. the render distance in meters per
    chunk is: (1m/scalar) \* 32
6.  render\_distance\_vertical: The vertical render distance in chunk.
    the math is the same as render\_distance\_horizontal
7.  out\_topic: The topic name of the topic this node publishes to
8.  max\_chunks: The maximum amount of chunks this node is allowed to
    store in RAM (ROM chunk storage is WIP). THIS HAS TO BE A POWER OF 2
9.  obj\_filepath: The filepath, where the wavefront file gets created.

Installation guide
------------------

Note that this packages target ros2 humble so I dont know if it will run
on newer ros2 versions.

-   Install the mesh navigation package from Naturerobots
    <https://github.com/naturerobots/mesh_navigation>

-   Clone this and set the parameters in the launch file

-   Build the package:

        colcon build #or colcon build --packages-select online_mesh_mapper

Running the package
-------------------

To start the node run the command:

    ros2 launch online_mesh_mapper mapper_launch.py

Known issues
------------

Setting the max\_chunks too high in my case 2\^15 and higher causes ros2
to kill the program. I havent yet found a solution for this. All I know
about this is that this doesnt happen when running the mapping model
outside of ros2.

To avoid this issue I recommend keeping the max\_chunks parameter at a
lower amount. Alternatively you can start 2\^32 and work your way down
until it stops crashing.
